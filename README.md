Dear Trainers, 

herewith I subtmit my fourth Code Review as agreed on 24 hours later than the standard deadline.

I made an Index file where I added the basic layout of the page like Header, Nav and Footer. I styled these with bootstraps and added an extra scss file and linked it as css for the added styles.

I made a JSON file with 6 basic movies, just as instructed with name, image, description and likes.

I parsed this into the JS file and did two main outputs one the beginning layout and then the one after the like button is pressed and sorted.

The like button works by simple click and the sort button just the same way. I had several failed attempts but left only a few in there as this was already the second version of the JS file. 

Thank you very much for reviewing my code.

Best regards

Marius
